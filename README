!!! don't try to run this project without images and database
(not available at the moment on Github)

****************************
*** minimal requirements ***
****************************

- Eclipse (installation tested with Eclipse Indigo version: 3.7)
- ADT plugin for Eclipse (Android Development Tools)
- Android 2.2 (API 8) SDK Platform
- Java 6
- AndEngine GLES1 (master branch) commit 4bc42a5ad1 (Apr 09, 2012) or higher (search nicolasgramlich/AndEngine on Github)
>> on Github, go on branch master then ZIP->download this repository as a zip file
>> be careful that following the Downloads link you will get GLES2 and not master branch, and that will not work

********************
*** installation ***
********************

First install Eclipse, Java and SDK Platform.

Java
- download and install Java 6 (not 7), get it by synaptic or whatever. OpenJDK 6 or Sun version for Windows.

Eclipse & Java
- download and install Eclipse (Indigo is ok, higher should be too)
- launch Eclipse
- in Eclipse, go to Help/Install new software then Add:
>> name: ADT plugin
>> location: http://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

Android SDK
- download android sdk http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
- put it in a convenient location on your disk

Eclipse/SDK link
- in Eclipse Window/preferences/android browse to the SDK folder

Then import AndEngine and Ragdoll projects into your workspace.

- download AndEngine GLES1 (master branch)
- in Eclipse, File/Import/General/Existing projects into workspace, add AndEngine directory (copy project into workspace)
- you may need to fix few errors, see AndEngine README
>> usually go to Window/Preferences/Java/Compiler/Configure Project Specific Settings to change compliance level to 1.6
>> add res directory if needed (right click on projet then New/Folder)

- download ragdoll sources

First solution:
***************
- import project as you did for AndEngine
- copy data in appropriate directories on your disk:
> res/raw for database
> res/drawable-xxx for images
> right click on project, then Refresh to have them appearing in Eclipse
> now clean everything and build everything:
> clean project: Project/Clean
> uncheck Project/Build automatically
> build project to generate R file: Project/Build Project
> check again Build automatically 

If needed:
- if the link to AndEngine is broken:
> right click on andengine_src repertory, then delete
> right click on the project, then Build Path/Link Source and browse for AndEngine/src repertory, then choose a convenient name for your link

!!! Every times you change a file on your disk, don't forget to Refresh project before launching

Second solution:
****************
If you are not able to get rid of all errors, try this way:
- create a new Android Project (File/New/Project/Android)
> fill the name, then Next
> target Android 2.2
> package name eu.clementime.rds
> don't create activity
> minimum SDK 8

- copy downloaded source files in your newly created project, in the same directories
> src/eu/clementime/rds for java files
> assets/font for fonts
> res/layout for android layout
> res/values for strings and themes
> root directory for the others

> res/raw for database
> res/drawable-xxx for images
!!! currently database and images are not on GitHub. You can't run the project without these files

- right click on your imported project, then Build Path/Configure Build Path
- Link source (browse AndEngine/src directory and choose a convenient name)

**********************************
*** run in smartphone/emulator ***
**********************************

smartphone
- allow your smartphone to run non-Market applications in Settings/Applications/Unknown sources
- connect your smartphone
- right click your project and Run as Android application

Emulator
- in Eclipse, Window/AVD Manager, set a new Android Virtual Device
  exemple for a Samsung Gio:
> target Android 2.2
> builtin WVGA854
> LCD pixel height 480
> LCD pixel width 320
> abstracted LCD density 240
- right click your project, Run as Android application/Launch a new Android Virtual Device

****************
*** see logs ***
****************

You can see logs in Eclipse but for full screen use adb logcat.

- open a terminal and go into the SDK directory (the one you chose),
- in platform-tools directory, then launch adb:
$ cd ~/.../andsdk/platform-tools
$ ./adb logcat
- focus on the AndEngine and Clementime tags to read the logs
